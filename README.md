# MKS-SERVO42D/57D
The MKS SERVO42D/57D_RS485 closed-loop stepper motor is a product
independently developed by the Maker Base to meet market demands. It features a
pulse interface and an RS485 interface, a built-in high-efficiency FOC vector
algorithm , and a high-precision encoder . Through position feedback , it effectively
prevents step loss. It is suitable for applications such as small robotic arms , 3D
printers , engraving machines, writing machines , automation products , and e-sports
competitions .
